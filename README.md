Collaborators:  
James Isom  
Reza Ebrahimi  
Ryan Juza  
Bindu Madhavi Peddireddy  
Naike Placide  

Collaboration tools:  
  Microsoft Teams  
  Visual Studio Code  
  GitHub   
  
  The reason why we chose VS Code instead of other IDEs is because of it's compatibility with Github. VS Code makes it very simple to push commits and pull them from other collaborators.
  
  The test case file (test-results.png) has 2 sets of tests. The first 7 images are before refactoring and the next 4 are after refactoring.

   If you want to run the unittesting in VS Code like we did, please download the "UnitTesting_in_VSCode" word file.  
  
  
  Please Note: There was an indentation issue in the original code, which gave incorrect results when testing our refactored version. This error has since been fixed and now displays the same results as our code.
